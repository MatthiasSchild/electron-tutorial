Electron Tutorial
=================

This code is the result of my Electron Tutorial available here:

[matthiasschild.de/create-an-electron-app/](https://matthiasschild.de/create-an-electron-app/)

This is an Electron with the following goals:

- You should have a runnable Electron app
- The logic should be written in TypeScript
- The view should be written with React
- The styling should be written in Sass
- The code should be updated without restarting the app
- The app should automatically refresh
